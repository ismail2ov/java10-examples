== Purpose
This project provides a set of Java code examples illustrating the new language features and APIs introduced in Java 10.

The examples are implemented as a set of easy to run tests, using JUnit (5).

== Source Code
The source code for the examples can be found in the src/test/java folder.

An explanation and guidance on the usage of each of the showcased language features can be found in the Javadoc of
each of the code examples. (See commands for generating Javadoc below).

== Building and Running the Examples
You will need to install a Java 10 JDK.

Support is provided for building and running the project using either Gradle or Maven as described in the sections
below.

=== Gradle
The minimum required version of Gradle will be installed if you execute the build using the supplied Gradle wrapper
script (./gradlew).

To compile and run all the example tests, enter the  following command in the project's root folder:

`./gradlew clean test`

To generate the Javadoc, use the following command:

`./gradlew clean javadocTests`

The generated Javadoc can be found in the standard location for a Gradle project - build/docs/javadoc/index.html.

For more details of Gradle build support see build.gradle in the project's root folder.

=== Maven
The minimum required version of Maven will be installed if you execute the build using the supplied Maven wrapper
script (./mvnw).

To compile and run all the example tests, enter the following command in the project's root folder:

`./mvnw clean test`

To generate the Javadoc, use the following command:

`./mvnw javadoc:test-javadoc`

The generated Javadoc can be found in the standard location for a Maven project - target/site/testapidocs/index.html.

For more details of Maven build support see pom.xml in the project's root folder.
