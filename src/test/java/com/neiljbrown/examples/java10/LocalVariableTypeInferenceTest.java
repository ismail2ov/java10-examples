/**
 * A JUnit test case providing example uses of 'var' - the new local-variable type inference feature in Java 10 (J10).
 * <p>
 * Type inference is the practice of the compiler figuring out the static types of variables and arguments so you donâ€™t
 * have to type them, resulting in more concise, and in some cases easier to maintain (refactor) code. Prior to J10
 * there were already a small no. of cases in which Java provided type inference. For example, the diamond operator
 * avoids the need to type generic parameters twice when declaring a collection. The type of the arguments of lambda
 * expressions can also be omitted where no disambiguation is needed. However, it is still the case that when
 * declaring variables, especially intermediate ones of parameterised generic types, needing to repeat the type on
 * the left-hand side of a variable declaration is burdensome. To address this, J10 adds support for local-variable
 * type inference. This removes the need to specify the type in a local-variable declaration, which is instead
 * replaced with the reserved type (not keyword) 'var', and the compiler fills in the appropriate type from the
 * variable initializer.
 * <p>
 * In J10, 'var' can only be used when declaring _local_ variables, and index variables in for-loops. It can NOT be
 * used in other places, including class fields, method (including constructor) params and return types.
 * <p>
 * Use of 'var' is an alternative to relying on your IDE's 'extract local variable' feature. The latter avoids the
 * typing overhead, but still needs to be maintained.
 * <p>
 * Use of 'var' can in some cases reduce as well as improve the readability of code. Use should therefore be reviewed
 * on a case-by-case basis. For example, to improve readability the type of variables returned by methods (rather than
 * created inline) may often be best declared explicitly rather than using var.

    final var anotherListOfStrings = new ArrayList<String>();
